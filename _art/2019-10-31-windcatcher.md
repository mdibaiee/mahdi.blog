Windcatchers (Badgir بادگیر in Persian) are an old Iranian architectural element used to create all-natural ventilation in buildings and water reserves (Ab Anbar and Qanats, see third image). These marvels are so effective at cooling, they can keep water at near-freezing temperature during summer days. They are still present in Iran and in neighbouring countries.
