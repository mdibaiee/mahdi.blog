Was thinking about what is creativity: connection of seemingly irrelevant concepts. Puns are creative because they make a non-obvious connection. The connection is not nonsensical, but not obvious either.

On Neurodiversity: Dyslexia is not a disorder if society doesn’t depend on reading so much. Reading new invention. What about people who have trouble using technology? Is that a disorder? Is it a bug of the reading and writing systems or humans? What if it was on a computer screen? Would we think of it still as a disease or would we fix the program?

Pieces from Austerlitz:
“As I think of how little we can hold in mind, how everything is constantly lapsing into oblivion with every extinguished life, how the world is, as it were, draining itself, in that the history of countless places and objects which themselves have no power of memory is never heard, never described or passed on”

“All I could think was that such a sentence only appears to mean something, but in truth is at best a makeshift expedient, a kind of unhealthy growth issuing from our ignorance, something which we use, in the same was many sea plants and animals use their tentacles, to grope blindly through the darkness enveloping us. The very thing which may usually convey a sense of purposeful intelligence- the exposition of an idea by means of a certain stylistic facility-now seemed to me nothing but an entirely arbitrary or deluded enterprise.”

“I sensed that in truth, I had neither memory nor the power of thought, nor even any existence, that all my life had been a constant process of obliteration, a turning away from myself and the world. If someone had come then to lead me away to a place of execution I would have gone meekly, without a word, without so much as opening my eyes.”

“In this dreadful state of mind I sat for hours, for days on end with my face to the <i>wall</i>, tormenting myself and gradually discovering the horror of finding that even the smallest task or duty, for instance arranging assorted objects in a drawer, can be beyond one's power.”

“At some time in the past, I thought, I must have made a mistake, and now I am living the wrong life.”

“Marie moved closer to me and asked whether I had remembered that tomorrow was my birthday. When we wake up tomorrow, she said, I shall with you every happiness, and it will be like telling a machine working by some unknown mechanism that I hope it will run well. Can't you tell me the reason, she asked, said Austerlitz, why ou remain so unapproachable? Why, she said, have you been like a pool of frozen water ever since we came here? Why do I see your lips opening as if you were about to say something, maybe even cry out loud, and then I hear not the slightest sound? Why did you never unpack when we arrived, always preferring to live out of a rucksack, as it were? We stood there a couple of paces apart, like two actors on stage. The colour of Marie's eyes changed as the light dimmed. And once again I tried to explain to her and to myself what incomprehensible feelings had been weighing on me over the last few days; how I kept thinking, like a madman, that there were mysterious signs and portents all around me here; how it even seemed to me as if the silent facades of the buildings knew something ominous about me, how I had always believed I must be alone, and in spite of my longing for her I now felt it more than ever before.”

“That evening in Marienbad, said Austerlitz, I could not admit to myself how right everything Marie said was, but today I know why I felt obliged to turn away when anyone came too close to me, I know that I thought this turning away made me safe, and that at the same time I saw myself transformed into a frightful and hideous creature, a man beyond the pale.”

“What made me uneasy at the sight of it, however, was not the question of whether the complex form of the capital, now covered with a puce-tinged encrustation, had really impressed itself on my mind when I passed through Pilsen with the children's transport in the summer of 1939, but the idea, ridiculous in itself, that this cast-iron column, which with its scaly surface seemed almost to approach the nature of a living being, might remember me and was, if I may so put it, said Austerlitz, a witness to what I could no longer recollect for myself.”

“Might it not be, continued Austerlitz, that we also have appointments to keep in the past, in what has gone before and is for the most part extinguished, and must go there in search of places and people who have some connection with us on the far side of time, so to speak?”

“No one can explain exactly what happens within us when the doors behind which our childhood terrors lurk are flung open.”

"What if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: "This life as now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence--even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existance is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!" Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: "You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine." If this thought gained possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you." - Nietzsche

Pieces from The Reader's Block by David Markson:

"If an ox could paint a picture, his god would look like an ox. Said Xenophanes"

"What has happened? It is life that has happened; and I am old."

"Despite decades of self analysis, Freud was so anxiety-ridden about missing trains that he would arrive at the station as much as an hour early. Freud."

Sylvia Plath: Horder prescribed her an anti-depressant, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, a few days before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because anti-depressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.
The nurse was due to arrive at nine on the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat but eventually gained access with the help of a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead of carbon monoxide poisoning with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30 a.m. Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30 years old. She left bread and butter and milk in the bedroom for her two children who were sleeping.

"John Donne posed for a painting in his own shroud. And kept it beside his bed during a long final illness."

"Manet was so vituperatively condemned by critics that for a time he was too embarrassed to ask anyone to pose for him.

"The Persians deployed so many bowmen at Thermopylae that it was said their arrows would blot out the sun.
To which a Spartan commander: all the better, then we will be fighting in the shade
In fact only two Spartans survived Thermopylae. One was killed in a battle elsewhere. The other hanged himself in disgrace."

"At twenty, Bach made a pilgrimage of more than two hundred miles, on foot, to hear Buxtehude play the organ."

"Aesop was a slave. Terence was a slave. Epictetus was a slave."

"I am weary, Ananda, and wish to lie down."

Galileo’s Abjuration 1633 ...I abjure with sincere heart and unfeigned faith, I curse and detest the said errors and heresies, and generally all and every error and sect contrary to the Holy Catholic Church. And I swear that for the future I will neither say nor assert in speaking or writing such things as may bring upon me similar suspicion; and if I know any heretic, or one suspected of heresy, I will denounce him to this Holy Office, or to the Inquisitor and Ordinary of the place in which I may be. I also swear and promise to adopt and observe entirely all the penances which have been or may be by this Holy Office imposed on me. And if I contravene any of these said promises, protests, or oaths, (which God forbid!) I submit myself to all the pains and penalties which by the Sacred Canons and other Decrees general and particular are against such offenders imposed and promulgated. So help me God and the Holy Gospels, which I touch with my own hands.  I Galileo Galilei aforesaid have abjured, sworn, and promised, and hold myself bound as above; and in token of the truth, with my own hand have subscribed the present schedule of my abjuration, and have recited it word by word. In Rome, at the Convent della Minerva, this 22nd day of June, 1633.  I, Galileo Galilei, have abjured as above, with my own ha

Prior to their departure, they both penned farewell letters, which along with an account of the final night they spent at the inn Gasthof Stimming, are now part of world literature. Upon their arrival in the vicinity of the Wannsee in Potsdam, Kleist first shot Henriette and then turned the gun on himself. They were buried together in a common grave at Kleine Wannsee (Bismarckstrasse), which has become a tourist attraction.

"'[Come Back to the Raft Ag'in, Huck Honey!](http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Come_Back_to_the_Raft_Ag%27in%2C_Huck_Honey%21)' argued a recurrent theme in American literature was an unspoken or implied homoerotic relationship between men, famously using Huckleberry Finn and Jim as examples. Pairs of men flee for wilderness rather than remain in the civilizing and domesticated world of women."

"Michelangelo finished _The Last Judgement_ in 1541. Fourteen years later Pope Paul IV ordered Daniele da Volterra to drape forty of the naked figures. Which Salvator Rosa would subsequently suggest made the whole wall look like a public bath."

<br/>

All of Plato came down from antiquity in less maimed form than any other writings, an undeniable sign of the esteem in which it was held.
Nonetheless when Aquinas and other medieval thinkers referred to _the_ philosopher, with no additional identification, it was universally understood that Aristotle was meant.

il maestro di color che sanno: the master of those who know

Within a few days of his death, Akhmatova wrote:
<br/>

<br/>
Leads moonlight to the axe.
<br/>
There's an ominous knock behind the wall:
<br/>
A ghost, a thief or a rat...

In 65 AD, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, a Roman statesman, organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Subrius Flavus and Sulpicius Asper, a tribune and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard. According to Tacitus, many conspirators wished to "rescue the state" from the emperor and restore the Republic. The freedman Milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero's secretary, Epaphroditos. As a result, the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including Lucan, the poet. Nero's previous advisor Seneca was accused by Natalis; he denied the charges but was still ordered to commit suicide as by this point he had fallen out of favor with Nero. Also Petronius. Lucan was 25 and recited his own verses as he bled to death.

Three years later Nero would be a suicide on his own part.

In Las Meninas, [Maria Bárbola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_B%C3%A1rbola?wprov=sfti1) is depicted in an unusual way for a person in her position at the time.

Cento: patchwork composition of quotations

In Canto IV of the _Inferno_, which is to say with 96 percent of his chief work yet unwritten, Dante has the temerity to rank himself sixth in the company of Homer, Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Lucan. Underestimating.

Sir John Denham once saved George Wither from being hanged by pleading that so long as Wither was alive, he, Denham, could never be the worst poet in England.

Except for Aquinas and the Bible, Descartes almost never read a word. He called the classics a waste of time.

[Nadezhda von Meck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadezhda_von_Meck): She is best known today for her artistic relationship with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, supporting him financially for thirteen years, so that he could devote himself full-time to composition, while stipulating that they were never to meet.

Nietzsche lost his reason because he thought too much. I do not think and therefore cannot go mad. Said Nijinsky, mad.

When Dickens, at twelve, worked from 8 A.M. until 8 P.M., six days a week, at the blacking factory, he also walked an hour each way to and from his family's Camden Town slum. And spent Sunday visiting his father in debtor's prison.

A small inheritance a few months later allowed his family to leave prison. Dickens was finally allowed to attend school over his mother's objections — she did not want to lose his income. School was short-lived though: At fifteen, Dickens had to return to work. Dickens never got over the time he spent at Warren's and his fierce sense of betrayal and rage at his mother's callousness stayed with him for life. Recalling that time, he said: "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back [to Warren's Blacking]."

Sir Thomas Browne wished that men could reproduce without intercourse. Like trees, he suggested. Fathering twelve children nevertheless.

‘Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’ -Matt Haig

[Ruth Ann Steinhagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Ann_Steinhagen): She told her doctors, after the incident, "I used to go to all the ball games to watch him. We used to wait for them to come out of the clubhouse after the game, and all the time I was watching I was building in my mind that idea of killing him."[5] In 1948, Steinhagen's family sent her to a psychiatrist, but her obsession didn't diminish, even after Waitkus was traded to Philadelphia.[3] After the shooting, police found extensive clippings in her suitcase and even pictures papering the ceiling of her bedroom.

By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true; <br/>
As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; <br/>
As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things. <br/>

"It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness." ([Opening lines of Paul Clifford](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/12/the-opening-sentences-of-paul-clifford.html))

Kant knew no music. And said that reading novels diluted the mind.

Though I never saw him, or had any personal communication with him, now that he is suddenly dead I realise that he was nearer, dearer and more important to me than anyone else. Said Tolstoy of Dostoievsky. (Mahdi: I used this method to measure how much I love someone. By imagiging how I would feel if they died.)

> The purpose of this note is to make it unmistakably clear that I intend to commit suicide by taking an overdose of drugs without the knowledge or aid of any other person. The drugs have been legally obtained and hoarded over a considerable period.

> Trying to commit suicide is a gamble the outcome of which will be known to the gambler only if the attempt fails, but not if it succeeds. Should this attempt fail and I survive it in a physically or mentally impaired state, in which I can no longer control what is done to me, or communicate my wishes, I hereby request that I be allowed to die in my own home and not be resuscitated or kept alive by artificial means. I further request that my wife, or a physician, or any friend present, should invoke habeas corpus against any attempt to remove me forcibly from my house to hospital.

> My reasons for deciding to put an end to my life are simple and compelling: Parkinson's disease and the slow-killing variety of leukaemia (CCI). I kept the latter a secret even from intimate friends to save them distress. After a more or less steady physical decline over the last years, the process has now reached an acute state with added complications which make it advisable to seek self-deliverance now, before I become incapable of making the necessary arrangements.

> I wish my friends to know that I am leaving their company in a peaceful frame of mind, with some timid hopes for a de-personalised after-life beyond due confines of space, time and matter and beyond the limits of our comprehension. This "oceanic feeling" has often sustained me at difficult moments, and does so now, while I am writing this.

> What makes it nevertheless hard to take this final step is the reflection of the pain it is bound to inflict on my surviving friends, above all my wife Cynthia. It is to her that I owe the relative peace and happiness that I enjoyed in the last period of my life – and never before. 

> Since the above was written in June 1982, my wife decided that after thirty-four years of working together she could not face life after my death.

Cynthias notes:

> I fear both death and the act of dying that lies ahead of us. I should have liked to finish my account of working for Arthur – a story which began when our paths happened to cross in 1949. However, I cannot live without Arthur, despite certain inner resources.

> Double suicide has never appealed to me, but now Arthur's incurable diseases have reached a stage where there is nothing else to do.

More and more he went running to the public house. But it was no longer to be among men, it was to get drunk. One might imagine him sitting there thinking those slow thoughts without words. One might predict that the day would come when we would realise very suddenly, very clearly, all that he had been thinking about, and, when this urgent, terrible thought had been translated into its own terms of action, he would be quietly hanged by the neck until he was as dead as he had been before he was alive.

- The Blind Man, James Stephens

----

The familiar saying that the exception proves the rule contains a good deal of wisdom, though from the standpoint of formal logic it became an absurdity as soon as “prove” no longer meant “put on trial.” The old saw began to be profound psychology from the time it ceased to have standing in logic. What it might well suggest to us today is that, if a rule has absolutely no exceptions, it is not recognized as a rule or as anything else; it is then part of the background of experience of which we tend to remain unconscious. Never having experienced anything in contrast to it, we cannot isolate it and formulate it as a rule until we so enlarge our experience and expand our base of reference that we encounter an interruption of its regularity. The situation is somewhat analogous to that of not missing the water till the well runs dry, or not realizing that we need air till we are choking.

"I find my own fun," said Justin, "I'm torn, here, by every single pang of annihilation. But that's what I look for, that's
what I want completed; that's the whole of what I want to embrace. On the far side of the nothing--my new form. Scrap
'me'; scrap my wretched identity and you'll bring to the open some bud of life. I not 'I'-I'd be the world ...
You're right: what you would call thinking does get me rattled. I only what you call think to excite myself. Take myself away, and I'd think.
I might see; I might feel purely; I might even love-"

The blood of the world is poisoned, feels Aunt Fran, with
her forehead over the eiderdown. Not a pure drop comes out at
any prick-yes, even the heroes shed black blood. The solitary
watcher retreats step by step from his post--who shall stem the
black tide coming in? There are no more children: the children
are born knowing. The shadow rises up the cathedral tower, up
the side of the pure hill. There is not even the past: our memo-
ries share with us the infected zone; not a memory does not
lead up to this. Each moment is everywhere, it holds the war in
its crystal; there is no elsewhere, no other place. Not a benedic-
tion falls on this apart house of the Major; the enemy is within
it, creeping about. Each heart here falls to the enemy.

Excerpts from _Existential Psychotherapy_ by Irvin D. Yalom:

Imagine a happy group of morons who are engaged in work. They are
carrying bricks in an open field. As soon as they have stacked all the
bricks at one end of the field, they proceed to transport them to the opposite end.
This continues without stop and everyday of every year they
are busy doing the same thing. One day one of the morons stops long
enough to ask himself what he is doing. He wonders what purpose there
is in carrying the bricks. And from that instant on he is not quite as content with his occupation as he had been before.
I am the moron who wonders why he is carrying the bricks.

Try to understand I want to be a man who belongs to someplace, a man
among comrades. Only consider. Even the slave bent beneath his load
dropping with fatigue and staring dully at the ground and foot in front
of him-why even that poor slave can say that he's in his town as a tree
is in a forest or a leaf upon a tree. Argos is all around him, warm, compact,
and comforting. Yes, Electra, I'd gladly be that slave and enjoy that
feeling of drawing the city round me like a blanket and curling myself
up in it.

What a change has come on everything ... until now I felt something
warm and living round me, like a friendly presence. That something has
just died. What emptiness. What endless emptiness.

I say there is another path--my path. Can't you see it. It starts here and
leads down to the city. I must go down into the depths among you. For
you are living all of you at the bottom of a pit ... Wait. Give me time to
say farewell to all the lightness, the aery lightness that was mine...
Come, Electra look at our city... It fends me off with its high walls, ted
roofs, locked doors. And yet it's mine for the taking. I'll turn into an ax
and hew those walls asunder..

Suddenly, out of the blue, freedom crashed down on me and swept me
off my feet. My youth went with the wind, and I know myself alone
and there was nothing left in heaven, no right or wrong, nor anyone to
give me orders... I am doomed to have no law but mine ... Every man
must find his own way.

Toward ourselves. Beyond the river and mountains are an Orestes and
an Electra waiting for us, and we must make our patient way towards
them.

Whether that be so or not, it would be well for man to behave as if it were so - Thomas Mann

Join a whole, work for it with all your body and mind. The meaning of
life lies in the chance it gives us to produce, or to contribute to something greater than ourselves.
It need not be a family (although that is the
direct and broadest road which nature in her blind wisdom has provided
for even the simplest soul); it can be any group that can call out all the
latent nobility of the individual, and give him a cause to work for that
shall not be shattered by his death.


The dangers of a nontranscendent posture are particularly evident in
interpersonal relationships. The more one focuses on oneself, for example, in sexual relationships, the less is one's ultimate satisfaction. If one
watches oneself, is concerned primarily with one's own arousal and release, one is likely to suffer sexual dysfunction. Frankl-quite correctly, I believe--feels that the contemporary idealization of
"self-expression" often, if made an end in itself, makes meaningful relationships
impossible. The basic stuff of a loving relationship is not free self-expression (although that may be an important ingredient) but reaching
outside of oneself and caring for the being of the other.

Three Categories of Life Meaning.
Though Frankl stresses that each in-
dividual has a meaning that no one else can fulfill, these unique mean-
ings fall into three general categories: (1) what one accomplishes or
gives to the world in terms of one's creations; (2) what one takes from
the world in terms of encounters and experiences; (3) one's stand
toward suffering, toward a fate that one cannot change.32

Buckley--there is no denying it- had a point when he insisted
that man's most ingenious invention is man, that to create

from wandering, or wondering, in some other direction where
a greater truth may lie, we set up all sorts of roadblocks and
traffic signals.

will die. That's why it came in, I suppose! Oh dear, what will

Excerpts from Total Fears: Letters to Dubenka:

It's like what happened to my mother, who,
according to her death certificate, died of softening of the brain
but I've attained such an absolute peak of emptiness and I'm so,
so alone, effectively in solitary confinement, tied up in a straitjacket, no longer living in time, but only and exclusively in space,
which shocks and horrifies me...

So anyway, Dubenka, I reckon, when a good person dies, to be
rewarded in heaven, the soul is transformed into a dove, like the
Holy Spirit descending as a dove upon the Virgin Mary or the
Apostles at the time of Pentecost. And when I saw those thousands
and thousands of dead pigeons and doves in the Budeé rotunda,
for me one of those doves was my wife Pipsi, who was so long dying
that in the end she became a saint... I remember how back in
Kersko, three days before she asked me to take her to the Bulovka
Hospital, she suddenly asked me to go up to our "signal box", to the veranda, and fetch a particular number of World Literature ..
I felt anxious ... Where was I to look? But she said to me softly
.. It's lying up there, I was reading it only yesterday, there are
planks and boards on the cover, as if they were making a scaffold
for the front page ... but ah . .. Three days before Gary Cooper
died of cancer, he asked for a silver cross and then just to be left in
peace... My Pipsi died on the third day too ... those last days of
her life, when she looked at me only twice, never before had I seen
her so beautiful, so youthful, so full of Heaven and sky ... And
twice in that time, maybe only twice during our whole life together
she said to me quietly, beautifully ... Thank you, Bohousku...
Thank you, Bohousku... My little dove flew up from the rock...

So we'll visit this Dievikov monastery, Dubenka, and we'll bow to Vysotsky
who, when his wife took him to Hollywood, was introduced with
her in the film club as "Mrs Vlady accompanied by her husband»
whereas by the time they left the Hollywood restaurant, and
Vysotsky had borrowed a guitar and played and sung for two hours,
it was "Vladimir Vysotsky accompanied by his wife".. We'll bow
to Yesenin, who shot himself, and hung himself too, to make quite
sure, in the Hotel Angleterre.

I'll leave my native soil behind, unable to overcome my sad
sorrow, become instead a wandering vagabond. Through the
countryside I'll roam, looking for the simple life, till one day a
friend pulls from his boot a knife ... Through the countryside I'll
walk alone, seeking for a gently warming sun -- the one whose name I say o'er and o'er, she will drive me from the door ..

### The Magic Flute

Sometimes when I get up and emerge from the mists of slumber,
my whole room hurts, my whole bedroom, the view from the window hurts,
kids go to school, people go shopping, everybody knows
where to go, only I don't know where I want to go, I get dressed,
blearily, stumbling, hopping about to pull on my trousers, I go and
shave with my electric razor -- for years now, whenever I shave,
I've avoided looking at myself in the mirror, I shave in the dark or
round the corner, sitting on a chair in the passage, with the socket
in the bathroom, I don't like looking at myself any more, I'm scared
by my own face in the bathroom, I'm hurt even by my own appearance,
I see yesterday's drunkenness in my eyes, I don't even have
breakfast any more, or if I do, only coffee and a cigarette, I sit at
the table, sometimes my hands give way under me and several times
I repeat to myself, Hrabal, Hrabal, Bohumil Hrabal, you've victoried yourself away,
you've reached the peak of emptiness, as my
Lao Tzu taught me, I've reached the peak of emptiness and everything hurts,
even the walk to the bus-stop hurts, and the whole bus
hurts as well, I lower my guilty-looking eyes, I'm afraid of looking
people in the eye, sometimes I cross my palms and extend my
wrists, I hold out my hands so that people can arrest me and hand
me over to the cops, because I feel guilty even about this once too
loud a solitude which isn't loud any longer, because I'm hurt not
only by the escalator which takes me down to the infernal regions
below, I'm hurt even by the looks of the people travelling up, each
o them has somewhere to go, while I've reached the peak of emptiness and don't know where I want to go.

I know, but in the end
I'm saved by those children of mine, the little cats in the woods,
who are waiting for me, they're my children, so I take the metro,
but now even the metro hurts, people go up, while others, and I
with them, go down, we stand in our places, going down the escalator,
then up the stairs I go again, and there in the little buffet I
guiltily buy four grilled chicken breasts, and guiltily I pay, watching my hands tremble,
because I'm buying chicken for the cats,
while out there somewhere in Africa children starve. Even that little buffet hurts,
and the busy street, with its trucks and private cars
criss-crossing in opposite directions, every driver knows where to
go, I'm the only one who doesn't, even if out there somewhere in
the woods my last hopes are there waiting for me, the last reason
to live, my little cats, petrified, in case I never come, what would
become of them, who would feed them, who would stroke them,
because they love me, those kitties, whereas I'm hurt now, not just
by my own little bedroom, I'm hurt by this whole town in which
I live, I'm hurt by this whole world, because towards morning
certain beings come to me - beings not unfamiliar to me, on the
contrary, they come slowly but surely up the escalator of my soul,
and not only their faces come into focus, but also certain horrible
events, just like a portrait, or a film, a documentary not only about
how I was ever madly in love, but also how I failed people.
So that interior monologue continues, no, I'm no longer talking alone with
myself; but it's as if I'm up before an interrogating judge, everything I ever said, everything I ever did, everything is always against me,
from this time on whatever I've been made to think about has
been against me. How many times I've crossed the road at the red,
how many times I've walked through the stream of traffic, but in
spite of being lost in thought, I am accompanied always by my
guardian angel, my little guardian angel, because this guardian
angel of mine wants me to remain in this world as yet, in order to
reach the final bottom, to go down yet one more flight, to the place
of the ultimate pit of remorse, because the whole world hurts, and
even that guardian angel of mine hurts, how many times I've felt
like jumping from the fifth floor, from my apartment where every
room hurts, but always at the last moment my guardian angel saves
me, he pulls me back, just like my Herr Doktor Franz Kafka, who
wanted to jump from the fifth floor, from the Maison Oppelt,
which you enter from the Old Town Square, but the Herr Doctor
would have fallen into Parízská, into Paris Avenue, he too was hurt
by the world, I suppose, and hurt by his life, just like Malte Laurids
Brigge, who also wanted to jump from the fifth floor, he was hurt
too by the world in Paris. Brigge was hurt by the whole world as
well, just like Rainer Maria Rilke.
I've victoried myself away, I've reached the peak of emptiness.

'All that's nonsense,' he said hopefully, 'and there is nothing in it
all to worry about! It's simply physical derangement. Just a glass of

stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly
petty it all is!'

Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very stockings for
drink? Not her shoes - that would be more or less in the order of
things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink! Her
mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own
property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold
this winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have
three little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning
till night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for
she's been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and
she has a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I
don't feel it? And the more I drink the more I feel it. That's why I
drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink ... I drink so
that I may suffer twice as much!' And as though in despair he laid his
head down on the table.

On marriage:

We excerpted "The Irrational Season" for ours:

But ultimately there comes a moment when a decision must be made. Ultimately two people who love each other must ask themselves how much they hope for as their love grows and deepens, and how much risk they are willing to take…

It is indeed a fearful gamble…Because it is the nature of love to create, a marriage itself is something which has to be created, so that, together we become a new creature. 

To marry is the biggest risk in human relations that a person can take

If we commit ourselves to one person for life this is not, as many people think, a rejection of freedom; rather it demands the courage to move into all the risks of freedom, and the risk of love which is permanent; into that love which is not possession, but participation…

It takes a lifetime to learn another person…When love is not possession, but participation, then it is part of that co-creation which is our human calling, and which implies such risk that it is often rejected.

"When my husband died, because he was so famous and known
for not being a believer, many people would come up to me-it
still sometimes happens-and ask me if Carl changed at the end
and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask
me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with
unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The
tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to
be reunited with Carl. But, the great thing is that when we were together, for nearly
twenty years, we lived with a vivid appreciation of how brief and precious life is. We
never trivialized the meaning of death by pretending it was anything other than a final
parting. Every single moment that we were alive and we were together was miraculous-
not miraculous in the sense of inexplicable or supernatural. We knew we were
beneficiaries of chance... That pure chance could be so generous and so kind... That
we could find each other, as Carl wrote so beautifully in Cosmos, you know, in the
vastness of space and the immensity of time... That we could be together for twenty
years. That is something which sustains me and it's much more meaningful.
... The way he treated me and the way I treated him, the way we took care of each other and
our family, while he lived. That is so much more important than the idea I will see him
someday. I don't think I'll ever see Carl again. But I saw him. We saw each other. We
found each other in the cosmos, and that was wonderful."

Death Speaks:

There was a merchant in Baghdad who sent his servant to market to buy
provisions and in a little while the servant came back, white and trem-
bling, and said, Master, just now when I was in the market-place I was
jostled by a woman in the crowd and when I turned I saw it was Death
that jostled me. She looked at me and made a threatening gesture; now,
lend me your horse, and I will ride away from this city and avoid my fate.
I will go to Samarra and there Death will not find me. The merchant lent
him his horse, and the servant mounted it, and he dug his spurs in its
flanks and as fast as the horse could gallop he went. Then the merchant
went down to the market-place and he saw me standing in the crowd, and
he came to me and said, why did you make a threatening gesture to my
servant when you saw him this morning? That was not a threatening ges-
ture, I said, it was only a start of surprise. I was astonished to see him in
Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.

W. Somerset Maugham

Theocles, proposes that the best candidate for the constant good that they are seeking is genuine
friendship, which he understands as love of humanity.
HEAR then! said THEOCLES. For tho I pretend not to tell you at once the Nature of this
which I call GOOD; yet I am content to shew you something of it, in your-self, which you will
acknowledg to be naturally more fix'd and constant, than any thing you have hitherto thought
on. Tell me, my Friend! if ever you were weary of doing good to those you lov'd? Say when
you ever found it unpleasing to serve a Friend Or whether when you first prov'd this generous
Pleasure, you did not feel it less than at this present; after so long Experience? Believe me,
PHILOCLES, this Pleasure is more debauching than any other. Never did any Soul do good,
but it came readier to do the same again, with more Enjoyment. Never was Love, or Gratitude,
orA Bounty practis'd but with increasing Joy, which made the Practiser still more in love with
the fair Act. Answer me, PHILOCLES, you who are such a Judg of Beauty, and have so good
a Taste of Pleasure; is there any thing you admire, so fair as Friendship? or any thing so charming
as a generous Action? What wou'd it be therefore, if all Life were in reality but one continu'd
Friendship, and cou'd be made one such intire Act? Here surely wou'd be that fix'd and constant
GOOD you sought. Or wou'd you look for any thing beyond? (The Moralists, II.1, 2:135)
Philocles has self-doubts whether he is capable of love of humanity in the abstract sense proposed
by Theocles.
I told THEOCLES, going along, that I fear'd I shou'd never make a good Friend or Lover after
his way. As for a plain natural Love of one single Person in either Sex, I cou'd compass it, I
thought, well enough; but this complex universal sort was beyond my reach. I cou'd love the
Individual, but not the Species. This was too mysterious; too metaphysical an Object for me.
In short, I cou'd love nothing of which I had not some sensible material Image. (The Moralists,
II.1,2:137)

Van Gogh

What would life be if we had no courage to attempt anything.

Unknown and uncelebrated during his lifetime, there was little demand for his
work. He used some of his art as payment for bills. Van Gogh only managed to
sell one painting while living.

Meanwhile his artworks have sold at prices as high as $82,500,000.

"It is good to love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever
loves much performs much, and can accomplish much,
and what is done in love is well done."

I don't know anything with certainty, but seeing the stars makes
me dream."

"The patient, though calm most of the time, has had several attacks during his stay in the
establishment which lasted from two weeks to one month... between his attacks the patient was
perfectly quiet and devoted himself with ardour to his painting.

On the day Van Gogh left the asylum, Peyron wrote a single word in the comments column: Recovery."

On 27 July that same year, Vincent Van Gogh shot himself in the chest. He died two days later, in
Auvers-sur-Oise.

I hold the knife. I just used it to scrap off some tape from my art prints so I could put them on the wall again, with new tape.
I think of the possibilities. Imagine cutting myself and sitting silently, and calmly, considering that I will be bereft or anything at all in due time. I consider what happens tomorrow (although there will be no notion of tomorrow anymore, soon). What will the people who knew me think? Feel? Anyone feeling guilty? Responsible? Cause and effect?
Knives look different now. So do bridges, high buildings. The custom house is my favourite, to make it absolutely clear to this place and its people. They will brushing it off as insanity or whatnot anyway. Or will they change? Very unlikely.
Electric shock. Wall plug.
Pills? Gun? Rope? I think I prefer the jump. Always loved parkour and skydiving and extreme sports. One last jump where I won’t have to be conscious of a need to open the parachute. One last, free jump. Take in the scenery. Liffey? Asphalt. Bam.

In the pale grass, under the vivid colors of the sky, the two gravediggers were lying on their backs, staring silently up at the heavens. The widow looked at them as she paused on the stile. Her thoughts of these men had been indifferent, subconscious up to this instant. They were handsome young men. Perhaps if there had been only one of them the widow would ahve been more attentive. The dark handsomeness did not seem the same thing when repeated. Their beauty, if one could call it beauty, had been collective, the beauty of flowers, of dark, velvety pansies, the distinctive marks of one faithfully duplicated on the other. The good looks of one had, to the mind of the widow, somehow nullified the good looks of the other. There was too much borrowing of Peter to pay Paul in their well-favored features. The first gravedigger spoiled the illusion of individuality in the second gravedigger. The widow had not thought so, but she would have agreed if anybody whispered to her that a good-looking man who wanted to win favor with a woman should never have so complete a twin brother. It would be possible for a woman to part tenderly with a man, and, if she met his iamge and likeness around the corner, knock him down. There is nothing more powerful, but nothing more delicate in life than the valves of individuality.

I Know the Truth

I know the truth—give up all other truths!<br />
No need for people anywhere on earth to struggle.<br />
Look—it is evening, look, it is nearly night:<br />
what do you speak of, poets, lovers, generals?<br />
<br />
The wind is level now, the earth is wet with dew,<br />
the storm of stars in the sky will turn to quiet.<br />
And soon all of us will sleep under the earth, we<br />
who never let each other sleep above it.<br />

["Trees" (1913)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trees_(poem))

I think that I shall never see
<br/>
A poem lovely as a tree.

A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
<br/>
Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;

A tree that looks at God all day,
<br/>
And lifts her leafy arms to pray;

A tree that may in Summer wear
<br/>
A nest of robins in her hair;

Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
<br/>
Who intimately lives with rain.

Poems are made by fools like me,
<br/>
But only God can make a tree.

[In Flanders Fields (1915)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Flanders_Fields?wprov=sfti1)

In Flanders fields the poppies blow
<br/>
Between the crosses, row on row,
<br/>
  That mark our place; and in the sky
<br/>
  The larks, still bravely singing, fly
<br/>
Scarce heard amid the guns below.
<br/>

We are the Dead. Short days ago
<br/>
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,
<br/>
  Loved and were loved, and now we lie
<br/>
      In Flanders fields.
<br/>

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
<br/>
To you from failing hands we throw
<br/>
  The torch; be yours to hold it high.
<br/>
  If ye break faith with us who die
<br/>
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
<br/>
      In Flanders fields.

Pieces from Sohrab Sepehri's poems:

<div class="lang-fa">

شب‌ در من فرود آمد.
<br />

شبیه هیچ شده ای
<br />
خودت را به سردی خاک بسپار
<br />

این دشت آفتابی را شب کن
<br />
تا من، راه گمشده را پیدا کنم، و در جاپای خودم خاموش شوم
<br />

خاک آیینه کنید از اشک گرم چشمتان سیراب
<br />

دست های شب مه آلود است
<br />

ریشه‌های روشنایی می‌شکافد صخره شب را
<br />

ساقه‌های نور می‌رویند در تالاب تاریکی
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

روزگاری است در این گوشه پژمرده هوا
<br />
هر نشاطی مرده است.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

با درون سوخته دارم سخن.
<br />
کی به پایان می‌رسد افسانه‌ام؟
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

گرچه می‌سوزم از این آتش به جان،
<br />
لیک بر این سوختن دل بسته‌ام.
<br />
<br />

تیرگی پا می‌کشد از بام‌ها:
<br />
صبح می‌خندد به راه شهر من.
<br />
دود می خیزد هنوز از خلوتم.
<br />
با درون سوخته دارم سخن.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

راه فرو بسته گرچه مرغ به آوا،
<br />
قالب خاموشی او صدایی گویاست.
<br />
می‌گذرد لحظه‌ها به چشمش بیدار،
<br />
پیکر او لیک سایه-روشن رویاست.

<br/>
..
<br />

تیرگی می‌آید.
<br/>
دشت می‌گیرد آرام.
<br/>
قصه رنگی روز
<br/>
می‌رود رو به تمام.
<br/>
<br/>

شاخه‌ها پژمرده است.
<br/>
سنگ‌ها افسرده است.
<br/>
رود می‌نالد.
<br/>
جغد می‌خواند.
<br/>
غم بیامیخته با رنگ غروب.
<br/>
می‌تراود ز لبم قصه سرد:
<br/>
دلم افسرده در این تنگ غروب.
<br/>

<br/>
..
<br/>

غمی غمناک
<br/>

شب سردی است، و من افسرده.
<br/>
راه دوری است، و پایی خسته.
<br/>
تیرگی هست و چراغی مرده.
<br/>

می‌کنم، تنها، از جاده عبور:
<br/>
دور ماندند ز من آدم‌ها.
<br/>
سایه‌ای از سر دیوار گذشت،
<br/>
غمی افزود مرا بر غم‌ها.
<br/>

فکر تاریکی و این ویرانی
<br/>
بی‌خبر آمد تا با دل من
<br/>
قصه‌ها ساز کند پنهانی.
<br/>

نیست رنگی که بگوید با من
<br/>
اندکی صبر، سحر نزدیک است
<br/>
هر دم این بانگ بر آرم از دل:
<br/>
وای، این شب چقدر تاریک است.
<br/>

خنده‌ای کو که به دل انگیزم؟
<br/>
قطره‌ای کو که به دریا ریزم؟
<br/>
صخره‌ای کو که بدان آویزم؟
<br/>

مثل این است که شب نمناک است.
<br/>
دیگران را هم غم هست به دل،
<br/>
غم من، لیک، غمی غمناک است.
<br/>

<br />
..
<br />

خشت می‌افتد از این دیوار.
<br />
رنج بیهوده نگهبانش برد.
<br />
دست باید نرود سوی کلنگ،
<br />
سیل اگر آمد آسانش برد.
<br />

باد نمناک زمان می‌گذرد،
<br />
رنگ می‌ریزد از پیکر ما.
<br />
خانه را نقش فساد است به سقف،
<br />
سر نگون خواهد شد بر سر ما.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

دره خاموش

سکوت، بند گسسته است.
<br />
کنار دره، درخت شکوه پیکر بیدی.
<br />
در آسمان شفق رنگ
<br />
عبور ابر سپیدی.
<br />

نسیم در رگ هر برگ می‌دود خاموش.
<br />
نشسته در پس هر صخره وحشتی به کمین.
<br />
کشیده از پس یک سنگ سوسماری سر.
<br />
ز خوف دره خاموش
<br />
نهفته جنبش پیکر.
<br />
به راه می‌نگرد سرد، خشک، تلخ، غمین.
<br />

چو مار روی تن کوهی می‌خزد راهی،
<br />
به راه، رهگذری.
<br />
خیال دره و تنهایی
<br />
دوانده در رگ او ترس.
<br />
کشیده چشم به هر گوشه نقش چشمه وهم:
<br />
ز هر شکاف تن کوه
<br />
خزیده بیرون ماری.
<br />

به خشم از پس هر سنگ
<br />
کشیده خنجر خاری.
<br />

غروب پر زده از کوه.
<br />
به چشم گم شده تصویر راه و راهگذر.
<br />
غمی بزرگ، پر از وهم
<br />
به صخره سار نشسته است.
<br />
درون دره تاریک
<br />
سکوت بند گسسته است.
<br />

<br />
دنگ...

دنگ...، دنگ...
<br />
ساعت گیچ زمان در شب عمر
<br />
می‌زند پی در پی زنگ.
<br />
زهر این فکر که این دم گذر است
<br />
می‌شود نقش به دیوار رگ هستی من.
<br />
لحظه‌ام پر شده از اذت
<br />
پا به زنگار غمی آلوده است.
<br />
لیک چون باید این دم گذرد،
<br />
پس اگر می‌گریم
<br />
گریه آم بی‌ثمر است.
<br />
و اگر می‌خندم
<br />
خنده‌ام بیهوده است.
<br />

دنگ...، دنگ...
<br />
لحظه‌ها می‌گذرد.
<br />
آنچه بگذشت، نمی‌آید باز.
<br />
قصه‌ای هست که هرگز دیگر
<br />
نتواند شد آغاز.
<br />
مثل این است که یک پرسش بی‌پاسخ
<br />
بر لب سرد زمان ماسیده است.
<br />
تند برمی‌خیزم
<br />
تا به دیوار همین لحظه که در آن همه چیز
<br />
رنگ اذت دارد، آویزم.
<br />

آنچه می‌ماند از این جهد به جای:
<br />
خنده لحظه پنهان شده از چشمانم.
<br />
و آنچه بر پیکر او می‌ماند:
<br />
نقش انگشتانم.
<br />

دنگ...
<br />
فرصتی از کف رفت.
<br />
قصه‌ای گشت تمام.
<br />
لحظه باید پی لحظه گذرد
<br />
تا که جان گیرد در فکر دوام،
<br />
این دوامی که درون رگ من ریخته زهر،
<br />
وا رهانیده از اندیشه من رشته حال
<br />
وز رهی دور و دراز
<br />
داده پیوندم با فکر زوال.
<br />

پرده‌ای می‌گذرد،
<br />
پرده‌ای می‌آید:
<br />
می‌رود نقش پی نقش دگر،
<br />
رنگ می‌لغزد بر رنگ.
<br />
ساعت گیج زمان در شب عمر
<br />
می‌زند پر در پی زنگ:
<br />
دنگ...، دنگ...،
<br />
دنگ...
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

دریا و مرد
<br/>

تنها، و روی ساحل،
<br/>
مردی به راه می‌گذرد.
<br/>
نزدیک پای او
<br/>
دریا، همه صدا.
<br/>
شب، گیج در تلاطم امواج.
<br/>
باد هراس پیکر
<br/>
رو می‌کند به ساحل و در چشم‌های مرد
<br/>
نقش خطر را پر رنگ می‌کند.
<br/>
انگار
<br/>
هی می‌زند که: مرد! کجا می‌روی، کجا؟
<br/>
و مرد می‌رود به ره خویش.
<br/>
و باد سرگردان
<br/>
هی می‌زند دوباره: کجا می‌روی؟
<br/>
و مرد می‌رود.
<br/>
و باد همچنان...
<br/>

امواج، بی امان،
<br/>
از راه می‌رسند
<br/>
لبریز از غرور تهاجم.
<br/>
موجی پر از نهیب
<br/>
ره می‌کشد به ساحل و می‌لبعد،
<br/>
یک ساله را که برده شب از پیکرش شکیب.
<br/>

دریا، همه صدا.
<br/>
شب، گیج در طلاتم امواج،
<br/>
باد هراس پیکر
<br/>
رو می‌کند به ساحل و ...
<br/>

<br />
..
<br />

روز خاموش است، آرام است.
<br/>
از چه دیگر میکنی پروا؟
<br/>

<br />
..
<br />

<br/>
(مرغ ساز افسردگی می‌کند)

<br />
..
<br />

از پی نابودی‌ام، دیری است
<br />
زهر می‌ریزد به رگ‌های خود این جادوی بی‌آزرم
<br />
تا کند آلوده با آن شیر
<br />
پس برای آن که رد فکر او را گم کند فکرم،
<br />
می‌کند رفتار با من نرم.
<br />
لیک چه غافل!
<br />
نقشه‌های او چه بی حاصل!
<br />
نبض من هر لحظه می‌خندد به پندارش.
<br />
او نمی‌داند که روییده است
<br />
هستی پر بار من در منجلاب زهر
<br />
و نمی‌داند که من در زهر می‌شویم
<br />
پیکر هر گریه، هر خنده،
<br />
در نم زهر است کرم فکر من زنده،
<br />
در زمین زهر می‌روید گیاه تلخ شعر من.

<br />

هنگامی که او از پنجره بیرون می‌پرید
<br />
چشمانش خوابی را گم کرده بود
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

لحظه گمشده

<br />
مرداب اتاقم کدر شده بود
<br />
و من زمزه خون را در رگ‌هایم می‌شنیدم.
<br />
زندگی‌ام در تاریکی ژرفی می‌گذشت.
<br />
این تاریکی، طرح وجودم را روشن می‌کرد
<br />

<br />
در باز شد
<br />
و او با فانوسش به درون وزید.
<br />
زیبایی رها شده‌ای بود
<br />
و من دیده براهش بودم:
<br />
رویای بی شکل زندگی‌ام بود.
<br />
عطری در چشمم زمزه کرد.
<br />
رگ‌هایم از تپش افتاد
<br />
همه رشته‌هایی که مرا به من نشان می‌داد
<br />
در شعله فانوسش سوخت:
<br />
زمان در من نمی‌گذشت.
<br />
شور برهنه‌ای بودم.
<br />

اون فانوسش را به فضا آویخت.
<br />
مرا در روشن‌ها می‌جست.
<br />
تار و پود اتاقم را پیمود
<br />
و به من ره نیافت.
<br />
نسیمی شعله فانوس را نوشید.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

نیلوفر
<br />

از مرز خوابم می‌گذشتم، سایه تاریک یک نیلوفر
<br />
روی همه این ویرانه فرو افتاده بود.
<br />
کدامین باد بی‌پروا
<br />
دانه این نیلوفر را به سرزمین خواب من آورد؟
<br />

در پس درهای شیشه‌ای رویاها،
<br />
در مرداب بی ته آیینه‌ها،
<br />
هر جا که من گوشه‌ای از خودم را مرده بودم
<br />
یک نیلوفر روییده بود.
<br />
گویی او لحظه لحظه در تهی من می‌ریخت
<br />
و من در صدای شکفتن او
<br />
لحظه لحظه خودم را می‌مردم.
<br />

بام ایوان فرو می‌ریزد
<br />
و ساقه نیلوفر برگرد همه ستون‌ها می‌پیچد.
<br />
کدامین باد بی‌پروا
<br />
دانه این نیلوفر را به سرزمین خواب من آورد؟
<br />

نیلوفر رویید،
<br />
ساقه‌اش از ته خواب شفافم سر کشید.
<br />
من به رویا بودم،
<br />
سیلاب بیداری رسید.
<br />

جشمانم را در ویرانه خوابم گشودم:
<br />
نیلوفر به همه زندگی‌ام پیچیده بود.
<br />
در رگ‌هایش، من بودم که می‌دویدم.
<br />
هستی‌اش در من ریشه داشت،
<br />
همه من بود.
<br />
کدامین باد بی‌پروا
<br />
دانه این نیلوفر را به سرزمین خواب من آورد؟
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

میان ما سرگردانی بیابان‌هاست.
<br />
بی چراغی شب‌ها، بستر خاکی غربت‌ها، فراموشی آتش‌هاست.
<br />
میان ما «هزار و یک شب» جست و جوهاست.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

سرگذشت من به لب‌ها ره نیافت:
<br />
ریگ باد آورده‌ای را باد برد.

[Fatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism)

----

Once upon a time there was a king, then a few dress makers offered to make him a dress that only noble and decent people could see. King really liked the idea and ordered them to make a coat for him. They start sewing their seemingly magical material, meanwhile no one actually sees anything, they look as if they are sewing on the air. They are finished with the coat at last and they carefully put it on the king. The king doesn’t see the dress himself, but because he doesn’t want to be found out to be not noble or decent, he starts praising the coat and pays them. Everyone in the palace also praised the dress in the fear of being found as not noble. Even people on street praise the coat of the king. I feel like someone once said Love and made a big deal out of his fantasy of being with someone and everyone else, in fear of being called weirdos just followed along and now we live in a world obsessed with love even though they can’t hold it together most of times

In 1845, the Illustrated London News reported that a Newfoundland dog had been acting less lively over a period of days before being seen "to throw himself in the water and endeavor to sink by preserving perfect stillness of the legs and feet". Every time he was rescued he attempted to do this again before he finally held his head underwater until death.

[A Man's A Man For A' That](https://www.scotsconnection.com/t-forathat.aspx)

Is there for honest Poverty
<br />
That hings his head, an' a' that;
<br />
The coward slave-we pass him by,
<br />
We dare be poor for a' that!
<br />
For a' that, an' a' that.
<br />
Our toils obscure an' a' that,
<br />
The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
<br />
The Man's the gowd for a' that.
<br />

What though on hamely fare we dine,
<br />
Wear hoddin grey, an' a that;
<br />
Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine;
<br />
A Man's a Man for a' that:
<br />
For a' that, and a' that,
<br />
Their tinsel show, an' a' that;
<br />
The honest man, tho' e'er sae poor,
<br />
Is king o' men for a' that.
<br />

Ye see yon birkie, ca'd a lord,
<br />
Wha struts, an' stares, an' a' that;
<br />
Tho' hundreds worship at his word,
<br />
He's but a coof for a' that:
<br />
For a' that, an' a' that,
<br />
His ribband, star, an' a' that:
<br />
The man o' independent mind
<br />
He looks an' laughs at a' that.
<br />

A prince can mak a belted knight,
<br />
A marquis, duke, an' a' that;
<br />
But an honest man's abon his might,
<br />
Gude faith, he maunna fa' that!
<br />
For a' that, an' a' that,
<br />
Their dignities an' a' that;
<br />
The pith o' sense, an' pride o' worth,
<br />
Are higher rank than a' that.
<br />

Then let us pray that come it may,
<br />
(As come it will for a' that,)
<br />
That Sense and Worth, o'er a' the earth,
<br />
Shall bear the gree, an' a' that.
<br />
For a' that, an' a' that,
<br />
It's comin' yet for a' that,
<br />
That Man to Man, the world o'er,
<br />
Shall brothers be for a' that.
<br />

I don't believe in omens or fear<br/>
Forebodings. I flee from neither slander<br/>
Nor from poison. Death does not exist.<br/>
Everyone's immortal. Everything is too.<br/>
No point in fearing death at seventeen,<br/>
Or seventy. There's only here and now, and light;<br/>
Neither death, nor darkness, exists.<br/>
We're all already on the seashore;<br/>
I'm one of those who'll be hauling in the nets<br/>
When a shoal of immortality swims by.<br/>

If you live in a house - the house will not fall.<br/>
I'll summon any of the centuries,<br/>
Then enter one and build a house in it.<br/>
That's why your children and your wives<br/>
Sit with me at one table, -<br/>
The same for ancestor and grandson:<br/>
The future is being accomplished now,<br/>
If I raise my hand a little,<br/>
All five beams of light will stay with you.<br/>
Each day I used my collar bones<br/>
For shoring up the past, as though with timber,<br/>
I measured time with geodetic chains<br/>
And marched across it, as though it were the Urals.<br/>

I tailored the age to fit me.<br/>
We walked to the south, raising dust above the steppe;<br/>
The tall weeds fumed; the grasshopper danced,<br/>
Touching its antenna to the horse-shoes - and it prophesied,<br/>
Threatening me with destruction, like a monk.<br/>
I strapped my fate to the saddle;<br/>
And even now, in these coming times,<br/>
I stand up in the stirrups like a child.<br/>

I'm satisfied with deathlessness,<br/>
For my blood to flow from age to age.<br/>
Yet for a corner whose warmth I could rely on<br/>
I'd willingly have given all my life,<br/>
Whenever her flying needle<br/>
Tugged me, like a thread, around the globe.<br/>
