Hi, it's Mahdi. I was born 24th of July, 1998. I write about a variety of topics here, whatever I find worthwhile to share with others.
I like so many things I'd better just list them instead of boring you by making up a fancy sentence about them, so here, in no particular order:

- Programming
- Mathematics
- Nature (conservation enthusiast as well)
- Rationality
- Artificial Intelligence
- Fitness
- Parkour
- All sorts of extreme sports: Skydiving, Scuba Diving, etc.
- Primitive Living
- Management (both self, and others)
- Leadership
- Human relationships
- Reading (I like this one a lot)
- Music and Art in general

I like communicating with people, exploring and discovering about new concepts and new possibilities, and every human being is a new concept to discover. In simpler terms, I would like to get to know you, so feel free to shoot me an email: hi@mahdi.blog
