During my trip to Southern Uganda I interacted with people who mainly spoke a local language called Rukiga. They said there is no dictionary for their language as of yet (although it is apparently being worked on), so I just kept asking them to teach me words and phrases and their grammar bit by bit. So here I‚Äôm sharing what I learned from my friends here in Uganda with you. Thanks to Tabitha and Tutamuzongoza and Jovan Tumwijukye specially who taught me and my friend a lot of these words and they spent time correcting the writing and pronunciation.

# Pronunciation
The ‚Äúr‚Äù letter is sometimes read with a sound that is in-between L and R (get phonetic annotation for these)
The ‚Äúk‚Äù letter is sometimes read with a ch sound (need phonetic)
Pronunciations may vary depending on the region. As an example, in one area we were told Musana means sun, but in another region we were told it‚Äôs pronounced as Mushana.

# Additional resources

The local people told me there is no dictionary of Rukiga yet, but it is being worked on and will be piblished soon. however, one potentially usedful resource for learning Rukiga is using a binle in Rukiga and comparing it to an English bible. A bible in Rukiga is [available online](https://www.bible.com/bible/1434/GEN.1.RR64).
