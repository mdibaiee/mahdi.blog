Is life beautiful? I ask this from people and gather the responses here, I hope
to reflect on it later with my own thoughts. Responses from different people are
grouped by a separating line.

I love when life stuff gets you so much it becomes funny and it feels like a
mystery or quest to solve

Or it has lots of cute moments in between of those quests

The feeling you get when you find like-minded people

The taste of food after you've been hungry

A good coffee with chocolate while you read in the morning

Sunrises/sunsets

Kids with their pure hearts and genuine interest to life

Sea/mountain air

Generally air in the morning

Feeling of a completed task

Or feeling right after you cleaned up and sorted out things

Interesting books

Melodies and listening to your body reactions

Jumping, laughing

Cows

These are cute

Potatoes

BATHS WITH BUBBLES

BUBBLES ITSELF

Genuine kids smile when they see bubbles

Or how dogs react when they see themselves for the first time in the mirror
