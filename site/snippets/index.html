    <p>Short snippets of thought. Ramblings. Random shite.</p>

<hr />

<p>Was thinking about what is creativity: connection of seemingly irrelevant concepts. Puns are creative because they make a non-obvious connection. The connection is not nonsensical, but not obvious either.</p>

<hr />

<p>On Neurodiversity: Dyslexia is not a disorder if society doesn’t depend on reading so much. Reading new invention. What about people who have trouble using technology? Is that a disorder? Is it a bug of the reading and writing systems or humans? What if it was on a computer screen? Would we think of it still as a disease or would we fix the program?</p>

<hr />

<p>Pieces from Austerlitz:
“As I think of how little we can hold in mind, how everything is constantly lapsing into oblivion with every extinguished life, how the world is, as it were, draining itself, in that the history of countless places and objects which themselves have no power of memory is never heard, never described or passed on”</p>

<p>“All I could think was that such a sentence only appears to mean something, but in truth is at best a makeshift expedient, a kind of unhealthy growth issuing from our ignorance, something which we use, in the same was many sea plants and animals use their tentacles, to grope blindly through the darkness enveloping us. The very thing which may usually convey a sense of purposeful intelligence- the exposition of an idea by means of a certain stylistic facility-now seemed to me nothing but an entirely arbitrary or deluded enterprise.”</p>

<p>“I sensed that in truth, I had neither memory nor the power of thought, nor even any existence, that all my life had been a constant process of obliteration, a turning away from myself and the world. If someone had come then to lead me away to a place of execution I would have gone meekly, without a word, without so much as opening my eyes.”</p>

<p>“In this dreadful state of mind I sat for hours, for days on end with my face to the <i>wall</i>, tormenting myself and gradually discovering the horror of finding that even the smallest task or duty, for instance arranging assorted objects in a drawer, can be beyond one’s power.”</p>

<p>“At some time in the past, I thought, I must have made a mistake, and now I am living the wrong life.”</p>

<p>“Marie moved closer to me and asked whether I had remembered that tomorrow was my birthday. When we wake up tomorrow, she said, I shall with you every happiness, and it will be like telling a machine working by some unknown mechanism that I hope it will run well. Can’t you tell me the reason, she asked, said Austerlitz, why ou remain so unapproachable? Why, she said, have you been like a pool of frozen water ever since we came here? Why do I see your lips opening as if you were about to say something, maybe even cry out loud, and then I hear not the slightest sound? Why did you never unpack when we arrived, always preferring to live out of a rucksack, as it were? We stood there a couple of paces apart, like two actors on stage. The colour of Marie’s eyes changed as the light dimmed. And once again I tried to explain to her and to myself what incomprehensible feelings had been weighing on me over the last few days; how I kept thinking, like a madman, that there were mysterious signs and portents all around me here; how it even seemed to me as if the silent facades of the buildings knew something ominous about me, how I had always believed I must be alone, and in spite of my longing for her I now felt it more than ever before.”</p>

<p>“That evening in Marienbad, said Austerlitz, I could not admit to myself how right everything Marie said was, but today I know why I felt obliged to turn away when anyone came too close to me, I know that I thought this turning away made me safe, and that at the same time I saw myself transformed into a frightful and hideous creature, a man beyond the pale.”</p>

<p>“What made me uneasy at the sight of it, however, was not the question of whether the complex form of the capital, now covered with a puce-tinged encrustation, had really impressed itself on my mind when I passed through Pilsen with the children’s transport in the summer of 1939, but the idea, ridiculous in itself, that this cast-iron column, which with its scaly surface seemed almost to approach the nature of a living being, might remember me and was, if I may so put it, said Austerlitz, a witness to what I could no longer recollect for myself.”</p>

<p>“Might it not be, continued Austerlitz, that we also have appointments to keep in the past, in what has gone before and is for the most part extinguished, and must go there in search of places and people who have some connection with us on the far side of time, so to speak?”</p>

<p>“No one can explain exactly what happens within us when the doors behind which our childhood terrors lurk are flung open.”</p>

<hr />

<p>“What if some day or night, a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: “This life as now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence–even this spider and this moonlight between the trees, and even this moment and I myself. The eternal hourglass of existance is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!” Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: “You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.” If this thought gained possession of you, it would change you as you are, or perhaps crush you.” - Nietzsche</p>

<p>Pieces from The Reader’s Block by David Markson:</p>

<p>“If an ox could paint a picture, his god would look like an ox. Said Xenophanes”</p>

<p>“What has happened? It is life that has happened; and I am old.”</p>

<p>“Despite decades of self analysis, Freud was so anxiety-ridden about missing trains that he would arrive at the station as much as an hour early. Freud.”</p>

<p>Sylvia Plath: Horder prescribed her an anti-depressant, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, a few days before her suicide. Knowing she was at risk alone with two young children, he says he visited her daily and made strenuous efforts to have her admitted to a hospital; when that failed, he arranged for a live-in nurse. Commentators have argued that because anti-depressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.
The nurse was due to arrive at nine on the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat but eventually gained access with the help of a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead of carbon monoxide poisoning with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30 a.m. Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30 years old. She left bread and butter and milk in the bedroom for her two children who were sleeping.</p>

<p>“John Donne posed for a painting in his own shroud. And kept it beside his bed during a long final illness.”</p>

<p>“Manet was so vituperatively condemned by critics that for a time he was too embarrassed to ask anyone to pose for him.
Before Cezanne had gained any recognition he once burst into tears when someone sincerely admired his work”</p>

<p>“The Persians deployed so many bowmen at Thermopylae that it was said their arrows would blot out the sun.
To which a Spartan commander: all the better, then we will be fighting in the shade
In fact only two Spartans survived Thermopylae. One was killed in a battle elsewhere. The other hanged himself in disgrace.”</p>

<p>“At twenty, Bach made a pilgrimage of more than two hundred miles, on foot, to hear Buxtehude play the organ.”</p>

<p>“Aesop was a slave. Terence was a slave. Epictetus was a slave.”</p>

<p>“I am weary, Ananda, and wish to lie down.”</p>

<p>Galileo’s Abjuration 1633 …I abjure with sincere heart and unfeigned faith, I curse and detest the said errors and heresies, and generally all and every error and sect contrary to the Holy Catholic Church. And I swear that for the future I will neither say nor assert in speaking or writing such things as may bring upon me similar suspicion; and if I know any heretic, or one suspected of heresy, I will denounce him to this Holy Office, or to the Inquisitor and Ordinary of the place in which I may be. I also swear and promise to adopt and observe entirely all the penances which have been or may be by this Holy Office imposed on me. And if I contravene any of these said promises, protests, or oaths, (which God forbid!) I submit myself to all the pains and penalties which by the Sacred Canons and other Decrees general and particular are against such offenders imposed and promulgated. So help me God and the Holy Gospels, which I touch with my own hands.  I Galileo Galilei aforesaid have abjured, sworn, and promised, and hold myself bound as above; and in token of the truth, with my own hand have subscribed the present schedule of my abjuration, and have recited it word by word. In Rome, at the Convent della Minerva, this 22nd day of June, 1633.  I, Galileo Galilei, have abjured as above, with my own ha</p>

Upon their arrival in the vicinity of the Wannsee in Potsdam, Kleist first shot Henriette and then turned the gun on himself. They were buried together in a common grave at Kleine Wannsee (Bismarckstrasse), which has become a tourist attraction.</p>

Pairs of men flee for wilderness rather than remain in the civilizing and domesticated world of women.”</p>

<p>All of Plato came down from antiquity in less maimed form than any other writings, an undeniable sign of the esteem in which it was held.
Nonetheless when Aquinas and other medieval thinkers referred to <em>the</em> philosopher, with no additional identification, it was universally understood that Aristotle was meant.</p>

<p>il maestro di color che sanno: the master of those who know</p>

<p>Within a few days of his death, Akhmatova wrote:
<br />
Terror fingers all things in the dark,
<br />
Leads moonlight to the axe.
<br />
There’s an ominous knock behind the wall:
<br />
A ghost, a thief or a rat…

<p>In 65 AD, Gaius Calpurnius Piso, a Roman statesman, organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Subrius Flavus and Sulpicius Asper, a tribune and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard. According to Tacitus, many conspirators wished to “rescue the state” from the emperor and restore the Republic. The freedman Milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero’s secretary, Epaphroditos. As a result, the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including Lucan, the poet. Nero’s previous advisor Seneca was accused by Natalis; he denied the charges but was still ordered to commit suicide as by this point he had fallen out of favor with Nero. Also Petronius. Lucan was 25 and recited his own verses as he bled to death.</p>

<p>Three years later Nero would be a suicide on his own part.</p>

<p>Cento: patchwork composition of quotations</p>

<p>In Canto IV of the <em>Inferno</em>, which is to say with 96 percent of his chief work yet unwritten, Dante has the temerity to rank himself sixth in the company of Homer, Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Lucan. Underestimating.</p>

<p>By the early Middle Ages, every third church in Europe claimed to possess splinters from the True Cross. Or the nails. Or thorns from the Crown of Thorns. Several heads of John the Baptist existed, at least as many corpses of Mary Magdalen. Not to add Christ’s foreskin.</p>

<p>Nietzsche lost his reason because he thought too much. I do not think and therefore cannot go mad. Said Nijinsky, mad.</p>

<p>When Dickens, at twelve, worked from 8 A.M. until 8 P.M., six days a week, at the blacking factory, he also walked an hour each way to and from his family’s Camden Town slum. And spent Sunday visiting his father in debtor’s prison.</p>

<p>A small inheritance a few months later allowed his family to leave prison. Dickens was finally allowed to attend school over his mother’s objections — she did not want to lose his income. School was short-lived though: At fifteen, Dickens had to return to work. Dickens never got over the time he spent at Warren’s and his fierce sense of betrayal and rage at his mother’s callousness stayed with him for life. Recalling that time, he said: “I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back [to Warren’s Blacking].”</p>

We used to wait for them to come out of the clubhouse after the game, and all the time I was watching I was building in my mind that idea of killing him.”[5] In 1948, Steinhagen’s family sent her to a psychiatrist, but her obsession didn’t diminish, even after Waitkus was traded to Philadelphia.[3] After the shooting, police found extensive clippings in her suitcase and even pictures papering the ceiling of her bedroom.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Koestler?wprov=sfti1">Arthur Koestler</a> committed suicide with his wife Cynthia. The notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To whom it may concern.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of this note is to make it unmistakably clear that I intend to commit suicide by taking an overdose of drugs without the knowledge or aid of any other person. The drugs have been legally obtained and hoarded over a considerable period.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Trying to commit suicide is a gamble the outcome of which will be known to the gambler only if the attempt fails, but not if it succeeds. Should this attempt fail and I survive it in a physically or mentally impaired state, in which I can no longer control what is done to me, or communicate my wishes, I hereby request that I be allowed to die in my own home and not be resuscitated or kept alive by artificial means. I further request that my wife, or a physician, or any friend present, should invoke habeas corpus against any attempt to remove me forcibly from my house to hospital.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>My reasons for deciding to put an end to my life are simple and compelling: Parkinson’s disease and the slow-killing variety of leukaemia (CCI). I kept the latter a secret even from intimate friends to save them distress. After a more or less steady physical decline over the last years, the process has now reached an acute state with added complications which make it advisable to seek self-deliverance now, before I become incapable of making the necessary arrangements.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I wish my friends to know that I am leaving their company in a peaceful frame of mind, with some timid hopes for a de-personalised after-life beyond due confines of space, time and matter and beyond the limits of our comprehension. This “oceanic feeling” has often sustained me at difficult moments, and does so now, while I am writing this.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What makes it nevertheless hard to take this final step is the reflection of the pain it is bound to inflict on my surviving friends, above all my wife Cynthia. It is to her that I owe the relative peace and happiness that I enjoyed in the last period of my life – and never before.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since the above was written in June 1982, my wife decided that after thirty-four years of working together she could not face life after my death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cynthias notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I fear both death and the act of dying that lies ahead of us. I should have liked to finish my account of working for Arthur – a story which began when our paths happened to cross in 1949. However, I cannot live without Arthur, despite certain inner resources.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Double suicide has never appealed to me, but now Arthur’s incurable diseases have reached a stage where there is nothing else to do.</p>

<p>More and more he went running to the public house. But it was no longer to be among men, it was to get drunk. One might imagine him sitting there thinking those slow thoughts without words. One might predict that the day would come when we would realise very suddenly, very clearly, all that he had been thinking about, and, when this urgent, terrible thought had been translated into its own terms of action, he would be quietly hanged by the neck until he was as dead as he had been before he was alive.</p>

<p>The familiar saying that the exception proves the rule contains a good deal of wisdom, though from the standpoint of formal logic it became an absurdity as soon as “prove” no longer meant “put on trial.” The old saw began to be profound psychology from the time it ceased to have standing in logic. What it might well suggest to us today is that, if a rule has absolutely no exceptions, it is not recognized as a rule or as anything else; it is then part of the background of experience of which we tend to remain unconscious. Never having experienced anything in contrast to it, we cannot isolate it and formulate it as a rule until we so enlarge our experience and expand our base of reference that we encounter an interruption of its regularity. The situation is somewhat analogous to that of not missing the water till the well runs dry, or not realizing that we need air till we are choking.</p>

<p>In the pale grass, under the vivid colors of the sky, the two gravediggers were lying on their backs, staring silently up at the heavens. The widow looked at them as she paused on the stile. Her thoughts of these men had been indifferent, subconscious up to this instant. They were handsome young men. Perhaps if there had been only one of them the widow would ahve been more attentive. The dark handsomeness did not seem the same thing when repeated. Their beauty, if one could call it beauty, had been collective, the beauty of flowers, of dark, velvety pansies, the distinctive marks of one faithfully duplicated on the other. The good looks of one had, to the mind of the widow, somehow nullified the good looks of the other. There was too much borrowing of Peter to pay Paul in their well-favored features. The first gravedigger spoiled the illusion of individuality in the second gravedigger. The widow had not thought so, but she would have agreed if anybody whispered to her that a good-looking man who wanted to win favor with a woman should never have so complete a twin brother. It would be possible for a woman to part tenderly with a man, and, if she met his iamge and likeness around the corner, knock him down. There is nothing more powerful, but nothing more delicate in life than the valves of individuality.</p>

شب‌ در من فرود آمد.
<br />

شبیه هیچ شده ای
<br />
خودت را به سردی خاک بسپار

این دشت آفتابی را شب کن

تا من، راه گمشده را پیدا کنم، و در جاپای خودم خاموش شوم
<br />

خاک آیینه کنید از اشک گرم چشمتان سیراب
<br />

دست های شب مه آلود است
<br />

ریشه‌های روشنایی می‌شکافد صخره شب را
<br />

ساقه‌های نور می‌رویند در تالاب تاریکی

روزگاری است در این گوشه پژمرده هوا

تیرگی می‌آید.
<br />
دشت می‌گیرد آرام.
<br />
قصه رنگی روز
<br />
می‌رود رو به تمام.
<br />
<br />

شاخه‌ها پژمرده است.
<br />
سنگ‌ها افسرده است.
<br />
رود می‌نالد.
<br />
جغد می‌خواند.

غم بیامیخته با رنگ غروب.
<br />
می‌تراود ز لبم قصه سرد:
<br />
دلم افسرده در این تنگ غروب.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

غمی غمناک
<br />

شب سردی است، و من افسرده.
<br />
راه دوری است، و پایی خسته.
<br />
تیرگی هست و چراغی مرده.
<br />

می‌کنم، تنها، از جاده عبور:
<br />
دور ماندند ز من آدم‌ها.
<br />
سایه‌ای از سر دیوار گذشت،
<br />
غمی افزود مرا بر غم‌ها.
<br />

فکر تاریکی و این ویرانی
<br />
بی‌خبر آمد تا با دل من
<br />
قصه‌ها ساز کند پنهانی.
<br />

نیست رنگی که بگوید با من

اندکی صبر، سحر نزدیک است

هر دم این بانگ بر آرم از دل:
<br />
وای، این شب چقدر تاریک است.

خنده‌ای کو که به دل انگیزم؟
<br />
قطره‌ای کو که به دریا ریزم؟
<br />
صخره‌ای کو که بدان آویزم؟
<br />

مثل این است که شب نمناک است.
<br />
دیگران را هم غم هست به دل،
<br />
غم من، لیک، غمی غمناک است.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

خشت می‌افتد از این دیوار.
<br />
رنج بیهوده نگهبانش برد.
<br />
دست باید نرود سوی کلنگ،
<br />
سیل اگر آمد آسانش برد.
<br />

باد نمناک زمان می‌گذرد،
<br />
رنگ می‌ریزد از پیکر ما.
<br />
خانه را نقش فساد است به سقف،
<br />
سر نگون خواهد شد بر سر ما.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

دره خاموش

سکوت، بند گسسته است.
<br />
کنار دره، درخت شکوه پیکر بیدی.
<br />
در آسمان شفق رنگ
<br />
عبور ابر سپیدی.
<br />

نسیم در رگ هر برگ می‌دود خاموش.
<br />
نشسته در پس هر صخره وحشتی به کمین.
<br />
کشیده از پس یک سنگ سوسماری سر.
<br />
ز خوف دره خاموش
<br />
نهفته جنبش پیکر.
<br />
به راه می‌نگرد سرد، خشک، تلخ، غمین.
<br />

چو مار روی تن کوهی می‌خزد راهی،
<br />
به راه، رهگذری.
<br />
خیال دره و تنهایی
<br />
دوانده در رگ او ترس.
<br />
کشیده چشم به هر گوشه نقش چشمه وهم:
<br />
ز هر شکاف تن کوه
<br />
خزیده بیرون ماری.
<br />

به خشم از پس هر سنگ
<br />
کشیده خنجر خاری.
<br />

غروب پر زده از کوه.
<br />
به چشم گم شده تصویر راه و راهگذر.
<br />
غمی بزرگ، پر از وهم
<br />
به صخره سار نشسته است.
<br />
درون دره تاریک
<br />
سکوت بند گسسته است.
<br />

<br />
دنگ...

دنگ...، دنگ...
<br />
ساعت گیچ زمان در شب عمر
<br />
می‌زند پی در پی زنگ.
<br />
زهر این فکر که این دم گذر است
<br />
می‌شود نقش به دیوار رگ هستی من.
<br />
لحظه‌ام پر شده از اذت
<br />
پا به زنگار غمی آلوده است.
<br />
لیک چون باید این دم گذرد،
<br />
پس اگر می‌گریم
<br />
گریه آم بی‌ثمر است.
<br />
و اگر می‌خندم
<br />
خنده‌ام بیهوده است.
<br />

دنگ...، دنگ...
<br />
لحظه‌ها می‌گذرد.
<br />
آنچه بگذشت، نمی‌آید باز.
<br />
قصه‌ای هست که هرگز دیگر
<br />
نتواند شد آغاز.
<br />
مثل این است که یک پرسش بی‌پاسخ
<br />
بر لب سرد زمان ماسیده است.
<br />
تند برمی‌خیزم
<br />
تا به دیوار همین لحظه که در آن همه چیز
<br />
رنگ اذت دارد، آویزم.
<br />

آنچه می‌ماند از این جهد به جای:
<br />
خنده لحظه پنهان شده از چشمانم.
<br />
و آنچه بر پیکر او می‌ماند:
<br />
نقش انگشتانم.
<br />

دنگ...
<br />
فرصتی از کف رفت.
<br />
قصه‌ای گشت تمام.
<br />
لحظه باید پی لحظه گذرد
<br />
تا که جان گیرد در فکر دوام،
<br />
این دوامی که درون رگ من ریخته زهر،
<br />
وا رهانیده از اندیشه من رشته حال
<br />
وز رهی دور و دراز
<br />
داده پیوندم با فکر زوال.
<br />

پرده‌ای می‌گذرد،
<br />
پرده‌ای می‌آید:
<br />
می‌رود نقش پی نقش دگر،
<br />
رنگ می‌لغزد بر رنگ.
<br />
ساعت گیج زمان در شب عمر
<br />
می‌زند پر در پی زنگ:
<br />
دنگ...، دنگ...،
<br />
دنگ...
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

دریا و مرد
<br />

تنها، و روی ساحل،
<br />
مردی به راه می‌گذرد.
<br />
نزدیک پای او
<br />
دریا، همه صدا.
<br />
شب، گیج در تلاطم امواج.
<br />
باد هراس پیکر
<br />
رو می‌کند به ساحل و در چشم‌های مرد
<br />
نقش خطر را پر رنگ می‌کند.
<br />
انگار
<br />
هی می‌زند که: مرد! کجا می‌روی، کجا؟
<br />
و مرد می‌رود به ره خویش.
<br />
و باد سرگردان
<br />
هی می‌زند دوباره: کجا می‌روی؟
<br />
و مرد می‌رود.
<br />
و باد همچنان...
<br />

امواج، بی امان،
<br />
از راه می‌رسند
<br />
لبریز از غرور تهاجم.
<br />
موجی پر از نهیب
<br />
ره می‌کشد به ساحل و می‌لبعد،
<br />
یک ساله را که برده شب از پیکرش شکیب.
<br />

دریا، همه صدا.
<br />
شب، گیج در طلاتم امواج،
<br />
باد هراس پیکر
<br />
رو می‌کند به ساحل و ...
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

روز خاموش است، آرام است.
<br />
از چه دیگر میکنی پروا؟
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

<br />
(مرغ ساز افسردگی می‌کند)

<br />
..
<br />

از پی نابودی‌ام، دیری است
<br />
زهر می‌ریزد به رگ‌های خود این جادوی بی‌آزرم
<br />
تا کند آلوده با آن شیر
<br />
پس برای آن که رد فکر او را گم کند فکرم،
<br />
می‌کند رفتار با من نرم.
<br />
لیک چه غافل!
<br />
نقشه‌های او چه بی حاصل!
<br />
نبض من هر لحظه می‌خندد به پندارش.
<br />
او نمی‌داند که روییده است
<br />
هستی پر بار من در منجلاب زهر
<br />
و نمی‌داند که من در زهر می‌شویم
<br />
پیکر هر گریه، هر خنده،
<br />
در نم زهر است کرم فکر من زنده،
<br />
در زمین زهر می‌روید گیاه تلخ شعر من.
<br />


<br />
..
<br />

هنگامی که او از پنجره بیرون می‌پرید
<br />
چشمانش خوابی را گم کرده بود
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

لحظه گمشده

<br />
مرداب اتاقم کدر شده بود
<br />
و من زمزه خون را در رگ‌هایم می‌شنیدم.
<br />
زندگی‌ام در تاریکی ژرفی می‌گذشت.
<br />
این تاریکی، طرح وجودم را روشن می‌کرد
<br />

<br />
در باز شد
<br />
و او با فانوسش به درون وزید.
<br />
زیبایی رها شده‌ای بود
<br />
و من دیده براهش بودم:
<br />
رویای بی شکل زندگی‌ام بود.
<br />
عطری در چشمم زمزه کرد.
<br />
رگ‌هایم از تپش افتاد
<br />
همه رشته‌هایی که مرا به من نشان می‌داد
<br />
در شعله فانوسش سوخت:
<br />
زمان در من نمی‌گذشت.
<br />
شور برهنه‌ای بودم.
<br />

اون فانوسش را به فضا آویخت.
<br />
مرا در روشن‌ها می‌جست.
<br />
تار و پود اتاقم را پیمود
<br />
و به من ره نیافت.
<br />
نسیمی شعله فانوس را نوشید.
<br />

<br />
..
<br />

نیلوفر
<br />

از مرز خوابم می‌گذشتم، سایه تاریک یک نیلوفر
<br />
روی همه این ویرانه فرو افتاده بود.
<br />
کدامین باد بی‌پروا
<br />
دانه این نیلوفر را به سرزمین خواب من آورد؟
<br />

در پس درهای شیشه‌ای رویاها،
<br />
در مرداب بی ته آیینه‌ها،
<br />
هر جا که من گوشه‌ای از خودم را مرده بودم
<br />
یک نیلوفر روییده بود.
<br />
گویی او لحظه لحظه در تهی من می‌ریخت
<br />
و من در صدای شکفتن او
<br />
لحظه لحظه خودم را می‌مردم.
<br />

بام ایوان فرو می‌ریزد
<br />
و ساقه نیلوفر برگرد همه ستون‌ها می‌پیچد.
<br />
کدامین باد بی‌پروا
<br />
دانه این نیلوفر را به سرزمین خواب من آورد؟
<br />

نیلوفر رویید،
<br />
ساقه‌اش از ته خواب شفافم سر کشید.
<br />
من به رویا بودم،
<br />
سیلاب بیداری رسید.
<br />

جشمانم را در ویرانه خوابم گشودم:
<br />
نیلوفر به همه زندگی‌ام پیچیده بود.
<br />
در رگ‌هایش، من بودم که می‌دویدم.
<br />
هستی‌اش در من ریشه داشت،
<br />
همه من بود.
<br />
کدامین باد بی‌پروا
<br />
دانه این نیلوفر را به سرزمین خواب من آورد؟

<hr />

<p>Once upon a time there was a king, then a few dress makers offered to make him a dress that only noble and decent people could see. King really liked the idea and ordered them to make a coat for him. They start sewing their seemingly magical material, meanwhile no one actually sees anything, they look as if they are sewing on the air. They are finished with the coat at last and they carefully put it on the king. The king doesn’t see the dress himself, but because he doesn’t want to be found out to be not noble or decent, he starts praising the coat and pays them. Everyone in the palace also praised the dress in the fear of being found as not noble. Even people on street praise the coat of the king. I feel like someone once said Love and made a big deal out of his fantasy of being with someone and everyone else, in fear of being called weirdos just followed along and now we live in a world obsessed with love even though they can’t hold it together most of times</p>

<p>In 1845, the Illustrated London News reported that a Newfoundland dog had been acting less lively over a period of days before being seen “to throw himself in the water and endeavor to sink by preserving perfect stillness of the legs and feet”. Every time he was rescued he attempted to do this again before he finally held his head underwater until death. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150326032017/http://news.discovery.com/animals/zoo-animals/animal-suicide-behavior.htm">source</a></p>

<p>Is there for honest Poverty
<br />
That hings his head, an’ a’ that;
<br />
The coward slave-we pass him by,
<br />
We dare be poor for a’ that!
<br />
For a’ that, an’ a’ that.
<br />
Our toils obscure an’ a’ that,
<br />
The rank is but the guinea’s stamp,
<br />
The Man’s the gowd for a’ that.
<br /></p>

<p>What though on hamely fare we dine,
<br />
Wear hoddin grey, an’ a that;
<br />
Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine;
<br />
A Man’s a Man for a’ that:
<br />
For a’ that, and a’ that,
<br />
Their tinsel show, an’ a’ that;
<br />
The honest man, tho’ e’er sae poor,
<br />
Is king o’ men for a’ that.
<br /></p>

<p>Ye see yon birkie, ca’d a lord,
<br />
Wha struts, an’ stares, an’ a’ that;
<br />
Tho’ hundreds worship at his word,
<br />
He’s but a coof for a’ that:
<br />
For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
<br />
His ribband, star, an’ a’ that:
<br />
The man o’ independent mind
<br />
He looks an’ laughs at a’ that.
<br /></p>

<p>A prince can mak a belted knight,
<br />
A marquis, duke, an’ a’ that;
<br />
But an honest man’s abon his might,
<br />
Gude faith, he maunna fa’ that!
<br />
For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
<br />
Their dignities an’ a’ that;
<br />
The pith o’ sense, an’ pride o’ worth,
<br />
Are higher rank than a’ that.
<br /></p>

<p>Then let us pray that come it may,
<br />
(As come it will for a’ that,)
<br />
That Sense and Worth, o’er a’ the earth,
<br />
Shall bear the gree, an’ a’ that.
<br />
For a’ that, an’ a’ that,
<br />
It’s comin’ yet for a’ that,
<br />
That Man to Man, the world o’er,
<br />
Shall brothers be for a’ that.
<br /></p>
