          <p>Today I and a friend went down a rabbit hole about Rust and how it manages the heap when we use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec</code>, and while we were at it, I found out there is such a thing as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Box&lt;str&gt;</code>, which might look a bit <em>strange</em> to an untrained eye, since most of the time the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code> primitive type is passed around as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;str</code>.</p>

<p>I’ve had a Kindle for more than a year now, but I’ve only recently started to read books on it frequently, I used to read paperworks before that, and I still do sometimes prefer paperbooks if available. Anyways, my Kindle has helped me to fall asleep without struggling with all my thoughts, all I have to do is read until I fall asleep, so in a way, it has also been a remedy for my insomnia.</p>

<p>Now to read the Kindle in bed, you would have to hold it using your hands or buy a stand or make one, motivated by <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/04/13/the-pursuit-of-laziness/">The Pursuit of Laziness</a> I set to create mine, but I didn’t use a piece of steel, instead I used a single box of cardboard I had in home to create one in minutes. :D</p>

          <p>I just want to leave this here as I often tend to look it up myself and the first time it was not as easy to figure out.</p>

<p>When using Travis CI along with GitHub (or other git integrations), Travis runs two tests: <code>pr</code> and <code>push</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/img/travis-ci-pr-push-github.jpg" alt="travis-pr-push-github" /></p>

<p>Most of the time you see both tests passing and you do not have to even wonder how they are different, but it has
happened to me that one of the tests fails while the other passes and I started to wonder why.</p>

<h3 id="pr">pr</h3>
<p>The <code>pr</code> test is a test run on the result of a merge between the pull-request branch and the main branch.
As an example, let’s say your pull-request’s branch is called <code>fix-user-auth</code> and your main branch is <code>master</code>, 
in this case, <code>pr</code> merges <code>fix-user-auth</code> into <code>master</code> and then runs the tests on the result of the merge.</p>

<h3 id="push">push</h3>
<p>On the other hand, <code>push</code> is run on the pull-request branch itself, without merging. So in our example above, Travis would checkout to <code>fix-user-auth</code> and run the tests.</p>

<h3 id="a-case-of-difference">A case of difference</h3>

<p>A case in which this difference might be more apparent is when your pull-request is based on a branch other than <code>master</code>, and some changes that your pull-request depends on are missing from <code>master</code>, in this case the <code>push</code> test may pass, but the <code>pr</code> test will fail.</p>

<p>So I just went on my first primitive living practice trip in the woods, alone, with only a pocket knife.</p>

<p>I decided I’m going to share the lessons I’ve learned in each trip as they are certainly going to be useful if you want to practice primitive living, I would find these useful if I could find them anywhere. I spend a lot of time reading and watching primitive living guides and experience reports, but they are never exhaustive, and this series is not meant to be exhaustive either.</p>

They spend time trying to find their dream partner, the perfect match, but hey, do you qualify

thought what kind of partner does he/she dream of?</p>
